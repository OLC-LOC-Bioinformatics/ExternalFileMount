## Irida Retrieve
An automated process that takes in a tab delimited text file as input. It parses
the input and moves sequences to an external drive in the proper format for the 
Irida Uploader.

#### How it works? 

Create an Issue on Redmine with the Subject "Irida Retrieve". Then attach a tab 
delimited text file with 3 columns for every sequence you would like 
moved to the external drive. The first column must be the SEQ-ID, the second 
column the proper sequence name and the third column the sequence project.


An example of a proper text file with 1 sequence that will be moved to the drive is shown below: 

2011-SEQ-1111	Realname1	Project_name

You will be notified when the process is completed and then you can pick up the external drive.
